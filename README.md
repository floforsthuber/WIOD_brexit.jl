The original paper *Global Value Chains, Trade Shocks and Jobs: An Application to Brexit* was written by Hylke Vandenbussche, William Connell and Wouter Simons and 
can be accessed from the KU Leuven library via this [link](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/535608).

The entire input data and output for this code is accessible via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18siumEZlDlu2N4TaKuEF4vds1VpMQJU-?usp=sharing).

# Preliminary results

The following figures show the final figures obtained. My results seem to coincide with most of the figures obtained by Vandenbussche, Connell and Simons, 
however, there are some considerable difference in the losses, in particular for the big European economies (DE, FR, IT).

I think the problem lies in an alternative matching of the sectoral elasticities, hence, some more work is required.
