The original paper *Global Value Chains, Trade Shocks and Jobs: An Application to Brexit* was written by Hylke Vandenbussche, William Connell and Wouter Simons (2019) and 
can be accessed from the KU Leuven library via this [link](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/535608).

The entire input and output for this code is accessible via my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18siumEZlDlu2N4TaKuEF4vds1VpMQJU-?usp=sharing).

# Results

The following figures show the final figures obtained. My results coincide with most of the figures obtained by *Vandenbussche, Connell and Simons (2019)*, 
however, there are are sizeable differences in the loss of value added in both Brexit scenarios for the big European economies (DE, FR, IT).

***I suspect the problem lies in an alternative matching of the sectoral elasticities, hence, some more refinement is required.***
